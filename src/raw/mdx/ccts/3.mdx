##### Create a Toy for the Neck & Shoulders.

## introduction:

_

/

​	This task was another individual one — to create a toy, or "object of play" for your assigned body part. Initially I was already a little confused, not knowing where the boundaries were and what counted as a toy. My daze was brought for another spin as I received news that the body part I got was "Neck & Shoulders". My mind was stuck before anything was even started. The only choice I had left was to just try to orient myself as I went.

## process:

##### Empathize

​	The hunt that had to go on to figure out where the line could be drawn, was intense. Divided into 3 parts, it was:

* **What's a toy?**
* **Why do we play?**
* **Play's past.**

​	A lot of querying and struggling around went on, but slowly one by one, the questions got answered. With those 3 keys obtained, the puzzle of the "toy" came closer to be solved.

##### Define

​	It was here I started chipping into the main concept. I tried to understand a little more about my assigned body parts, the Neck & the Shoulder. At first, the issue of not knowing where to bisect the topic affected this venture too. At the end, my subdivisions ended up at how the body part stands in & protects the human form.

##### Ideate

​	Finding ideas was quite a struggle for this assignment as well. Ideas initially were very straining to find, I came up with 8 ideas, with some mocked up & sketched out, but only 3 made the cut into the stack of the ones that was workable & (most importantly) fun to play with. Every idea went through a macro & micro phase to try to figure out what it would realistically look like. At the end, what was chosen was the "Playing Pole". It had game elements, like a goal & an optional increasing difficulty.

##### Prototype

​	At this point of the assignment the heavy lifting was over, and the rest of the process became a lot more linear & hurdle-less. It is split into a few parts & a few sub-parts:

/

* **Plastic String**, which is the string used to connect the pole to the rest of the toy. It is made using a plastic mineral water bottle.
* **Bridge**, which is what connected the "Bowl"s together & enables the ball to travel between.
  * *Problem*: **"Bridge" — Gap**, which will reduce its integrity.
  * *Solution*: **"Bridge" — Gap**, which is fixed by adding supports.
* **Bowl**, which is where the ball lives most of the time.
  * *Problem*: **"Bowl" — Hole**, which will let the ball fall out of the bowl.
  * *Solution*: **"Bowl" — Hole**, which is fixed by adding cut walls to fit the holes.
  * *Problem*: **"Bowl" — Stuck**, which will cause the ball to not enter the bridge.
  * *Solution*: **"Bowl" — Stuck**, which is fixed by adding funnel walls.

/

​	This prototype was definitely a lot more hands on & less plan-ny that the others. It started off as a sketch with pen & paper, evolving as it goes on. Starting from without even the bridge, into a semi-complete blueprint. Initially, comes the plastic string, then the bridge, then the bowl, then the tidbits. Problems came and go, with solutions presenting themselves to be quite easy. 

​	After the entire saga was over, I was left with a full toy, to be played with pleasure.

##### Present

​	A few posters & a infographic was created to try to promote & educate about the parts of the toy. I showed the toy to a sibling and adjusted it to enable her to play with it. She enjoyed it but had criticism:

* **Head piece not secure**, resolved by changing out the hat to something she had.

## reflection:
_

/

​	Overall, I feel like this assignment although tough, definitely instilled a lot of knowledge about how to work around the challenges I was thrown. From information hunting, to prototype problem solving, the hurdles taught me how to climb even taller walls. Other than that, I feel like I have figured out even more on how to think from a different perspective, specifically, dropping the down to earth magnet & letting the imagination run wild.
