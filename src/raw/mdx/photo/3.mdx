* This photo pulls your eyes onto the texture on the back of the iPhone, achieved by having sort of a “tilt-shift” effect using the thin focus plane of a close up shot.

* The warm and golden lighting shined onto the subject contrasts the deep blues of the keyboard, together complimenting each other in the colour wheel.

* Lines running across the picture are also 45° in the photo, creating a very geometric and almost orthographic view.

* The display also provides some nice “greenery” to accent the otherwise plain colour palette.

* The viewer’s eyes are pulled straight into the centre of the photo. This is because of the focus and the icons that are pointing in, almost acting as a lure for a trap.

* There were only 2 light sources, and one of them was natural lighting which acted both like a fill and back light in this situation.

* The colour palette chosen is a little different and the photo itself is not as warm as the others. It has a very artificial look towards it, which can only be perceived using colour.

* On a side note, this old thing still kind of works xd

* The subject is showered with light coming from behind after being reflected and bounced around by the plastic layer above it. It sits firmly in the centre and is the main focus.

* The plastic around the subject acts both as a background and a foreground, having the sensation of it never starting and ending.

* The reflections also subtly highlight the texture of the subject, creating even more visual interests.

* The backlight was originally a very sharp and harsh flash, but after passing through the not 100% smooth plastic layer, it gets diffused and produces relatively soft shadows as well.

* The subject is lit by a flood of natural light and a little backlighting from the very “stealthily” hidden flash, that is diffused by the plastic.

* This photo is also a lot more washed out and colder than the others, which adds to the overall emphasis on texture, shape, and shadow.

* The camera was positioned down low on the ground to give the subject a larger appearance than it actually has in real life, providing a perspective that’s unique.

* Most elements are also pointing or facing to the left, leading the viewer to where the main light source is coming from.

* The subject has very interesting geometry and looks almost futuristic. Sharp sunlight coats the surface of the fan blades, producing highlights that reel in the viewer to the centre.

* The unorthodox colour grading, paired with the grungy textures, make this photo sit very differently than the others in this series.

* The bars that run from the foreground, all the way through into the far background serves to lift the subject itself higher in “priority” for the viewer’s attention

* The large parts of black, which inherently posses 0 saturation, helps offset the otherwise popping colours.

* This picture uses its relatively monochromatic palette of colours as a tool to distinguish background from foreground, even if they have similar luminance levels.

* A big emphasis on texture is applied with every gadget sporting a different texture and different displacements as well. This creates difference in the way light interacts with them.

* With the plastic under the gadgets, shadows, highlights, reflections, and textures, were all emphasised. Almost like the gadgets were floating on water.

* The colder colour temperature also casts a blueish tint on the originally black gadgets, adding a little bit more detail represented through colour.

* This photo is literally two cameras staring at each other, but having the subject camera’s sensor bang on in the centre makes the viewer feel uneasy.

* There is a flash behind the subject camera which is shrouded in a transparent plastic casing. The casing lets the light from behind bounce around and illuminate the surroundings.

* The highlights are clamped as to not drive too much attention away from the main subject, which is relatively dark when compared.

* The distortion on the edge gives an effect of “infatuation” from the viewer, almost like they’re being hypnotised. This is achieved using some turbulence displace and fractal noise.

​	This series was a blast to capture, as it was right in my comfort zone. I was able to experiment a lot more with lighting, props, focus, and composition. Even with that, I still learned a lot of new titbits that will improve my future endeavours into colour photography.

​	The skill that I think I have explored and improved the most is colour manipulation. I played around with ways to alter tones, saturation, and luminosity all throughout the spectrum — shadows, midtones, and highlights. I used this technique to create more surreal looking colours instead of relying solely on the raw camera sensor data. In my opinion, this isn't a step that can make a photo, but it can definitely break it.

​	Through this assignment, I have also gained an appreciation for B-roll shots taken to showcase products. The sheer amount of planning and directing, paired with the colour science and composition framing expertise of the professionals, proves that the amount of thought, time, and effort being put into the (often short) shots is truly an admirable feat.

​	Talking a little bit more about the series itself, I decided on a 21:9 (or 2.370:1) aspect ratio to bring a look that makes things seem more "anamorphic", which basically tricks the viewer into thinking there's a lot more captured around the sides, than more cut off from the top. I find gadget photography to benefit from this as typically they are showcasing a subject, rather than an array of subjects. If taken in a taller aspect ratio, it makes it feel as if it's either too claustrophobic or too far away. With this wide ratio, the main subject can take up the same amount of vertical height as a square picture but with a lot more context at the sides to act as a breather. This lets the subject be as up close as desired, showcasing it like how an observer would prefer to hold it up to their eyes, inspecting the subject's details.

​	To conclude, a point has been made for the fun part of photography, especially with all tools available to go wild. This assignment might just push me to take more colour gadget photos and give more thought to the colour work that will form them.
