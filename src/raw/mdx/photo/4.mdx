​	The subject was having a semi internal monologue, asking questions from others while taking pauses to process and fit them into his “mind map”. I didn’t want to disrupt his train of thought so I decided to de discreet, not calling for his attention while I took the picture. 

​	As a side effect of using the smaller sensor in my phone instead of a DSLR, the natural background separation by the depth of field is not present. To compensate for this, I rotoscoped the subject and added pixel sorting to the background.

​	The photo, assuming viewed from left to right, equivalent to our text reading habits, will create a funnel onto the subject. The subject, looking back at the direction of where the viewer started observing, causes a almost ping pong like pattern. This also creates a “us vs them” dynamic that is subtly lain onto the viewer.
  	
​	The stealth tactics continue here and the same rotoscoping was done in this photo. Even with that though, the background was extra busy, so a mild camera lens blur was added as a simulated depth of field.

[//]:  # "Here the subject offers the toy as almost like a peace treaty. Her attention on the toy instead of the camera acts as pseudo proxy of eye contact. The ping pong effect is also observed here, albeit in a more subtle way. A very laid back and unguarded view of a person just goofing around is captured very effectively too."

[//]: # "A subtle blur and pixel sort were added using the same methods and for the same reasons. The photo was taken in low light with a small sensor, producing noisy results which were denoised."

​	The two people in the picture laughing it out, unaware of their surroundings. The viewer is placed straight into the scene, fully feeling the laid back and unguarded atmosphere. The composition drags the viewers eyes across the photo. As the viewer tries to find out what the two are laughing about, it is cut off. It can be anything, up to the viewer’s imagination.

​	Only a colour grade was applied to the image, as the subjects stand out enough from their surroundings. The creates a very natural and clear feeling photo.

​	This hair fixing session, without context can be interpreted in many ways, which is what makes this photo interesting. It requires the viewer to take a pause and interpret what they see.
  	
​	The rule of thirds is still followed in this photo, like all of the others, even though it might not be as obvious here. The decision was made to leave the artificial blur out of this photo when editing as the background was barren enough and subject apparent enough, to not cause any distractions.

​	The mouth-widening smile captured in this photo definitely gives off that emotion when viewed. Happiness and laughter, especially when caught on photo, is a moment to be remembered. The subject is also in an unguarded position, not posing or trying to present an image, which enables the photo to feel even more raw.
  	
​	The photo was taken under low light conditions with a flash shined from the top right onto the subject. This painted sharp shadows onto the subject and emphasised highlights. Blur was added onto the background as an added separator between foreground and background.

​	This photo shows a subject that was still drowsy from just waking up. We were talking and she was stretching to get herself up.

​	This photo is special because it takes advantage of the wide 26mm focal length lens found on my phone camera, as it gives a view that is more close up and real. There was also a green mat on the floor, which I keyed out and replaced with a sunset to complement the other warm colours in the photo.

​	This photo is commentary on the current pandemic situation. A public that is both busy to survive financially and healthily. Its warm colours contradict how the situation is portrayed — statistics and facts that are easy to disconnect from — even though it is a fundamentally close issue.
  	
​	The artificial depth of field on this photo is very much sold by the clear distinction of subject and background, with the highlights caused by the backlight acting as a outline. The optical flare was added to add onto the fully backlit subject.

### 8

![](../../img/photo/4/8.jpg)

/

​	This photo shows the subject working through the usual tasks that were not paused by the pandemic. It gives the viewer a perspective on how some things still continue to function even if the world falls apart.
  	
​	A DSLR was used to capture this photo using a zoom lens at afar. This allowed foreground separation to happen on its own and the subject to speak for itself. The warm colour temperature also contributes to a more “cosy” feel.

​	The cold temperature of the photo is different from the others that lean more to the warm side. The subject is seen to be stressing out after viewing something on their phone. The colours try to push the shock and wave of emotions when something like that happens. This is very much a blunter approach, but it’s also a lot more easily received.
  	
​	A DSLR was also used to take this photo, shown by the smooth bokeh transition on the table. This effect would’ve been hard to achieve otherwise without using a manually created depth map.

​	A classic moment. The few subjects, with their vibrant hues speak for themselves. The decision to isolate them from the background with colour was made to try to distil the pure essence of the moment down to the core contributors — the people.
  	
​	The photo required some amount of work to get to a point of colours working and mixing well together, considering that there are two very similar colours, and the two more that are very different. With the rotoscoped & desaturated background, it allows the unique mishmash of colours to take over and fill in where the ambient environment would be.

​	Moments in a household were rare, which makes them even more valuable of an asset for this assignment. I had to be a little more creative in order to make sure I captured the moments as they came up. This proved to be challenging and definitely trained me to be more aware of my surroundings. For example, to not disrupt and distract the subject, prematurely ending the moment, the camera could not be the focus of the subject.

​	The main takeaway from this assignment I have is how much the mobile camera phone revolution has enabled more instant captures to happen. One can simply pull out a device that fits in a pocket and proceed to take memories that would otherwise have been lost to history. This comes with its own hurdles though, as I found. For one, the quality is definitely not on par with a bulky DSLR, especially when fighting against the phone hardware's fundamental limitations. Situations like low light and far away shots, being limited by sensor size and lens selection respectively, are notorious culprits in choking phone cameras. These issues were encountered by me during the shooting process, especially because moments give no time for preparation (eg. bright lighting, perfect composition, minimal background noise). What this made me do was to try to explore new post production techniques that can sand down some of the rough edges from the photos.

​	Through the limitations hit, they gave me reasons to explore more on the core aspects of a photo. It became an interesting rabbit hole of recomposition and background suppression to bring out the moment itself, free of anything else that might try to rear its head out and steal the limelight. These core aspects mostly included only the subject and their actions, as that is what crafts the base of the moment.

​	The series was done in 3:2, the aspect ratio of 35mm film which were popular in yester years. In my opinion, this shape proved itself just right for most shots that were taken of the upper body while following the rule of thirds. This was also the aspect ratio of the small sensor in my phone and the slightly bigger APS-C sensor in my DSLR, enabling minimal pixel loss when working around the lower resolutions and detail levels.

​	To conclude, these series of photographs definitely made me expand my understanding and skills to workaround these strict limitations. With more experience and practice, a person who knows more about split second composition would definitely be able to squeeze higher quality results out of the precious moments. This assignment might just push me to capture more of the memories around me, as a moment is unique in the way that no other medium records them down better than a simple snap.
